    "For this project, I will be looking at the Data from the 2019 Data Science Bowl on Kaggle (link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2019/overview). You can see my Kaggle Submission here: https://www.kaggle.com/rkjiwa/kernel773761685d.\n",

    "For this challenge, we are provided with gameplay data for a early childhood education game, PBS KIDS Measure Up!. Our objective is to take test data, and create a prediction as to what accuracy group (0,1,2 or 3) a child scores in for the last assessment attempt. The expectation is a file containing the installation_id (represents each application install) along with the predicted accuracy group. The submissions will then be evaluated on a quadratic weighted kappa to measure how closely the prediction and the actual test accuracies agree. \n",

    "The main goal is to generate the predictions for the test.csv dataset to determine the accuracy group of the last assessment attempt.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in this process is to investigate the data and get in preprocessed to a state where it can be easily fed into the prediction models. Based off of the description that we received from Kaggle, there is going to be some work revolved around this. We can see that there is one column that has semi-structured JSON data, this will need to be extracted. Ideally, we would like get as much information as possible, and then depending on the results of our model we can optimize. Since we are looking at an assessment attempt (more specifically the last assessment attempt), and are trying to investigate the learning of the kid, previous attempts and activities are going to be important.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based off of the challenge, we are being asked to assign each installation_id within the test dataset an accuracy group. This sounds like a classification problem more than a regression problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation metric for the submission is a weighted kappa looking at the agreement between the predicted values and the actual values. This poses a challenge, because we are just given the test values and it does not appear that we have the labels (unless they are represented in the sample_submission, which is unlikely) to personally check the weighted score of our predictions. This gives us three options to measure our models. The first is we use our score from Kaggle in order to evaluate our models. The second is we split our training set into a training set and a testing set, utilize this to train and test our model along with evaluating the weighted kappa score and then applying our model to the train.csv data. The third option is to do a combination of the two. Where we split our training data, evaluate the model and then submit our kernel to kaggle and use the feedback from there to further evaluate our model."

    "The different activities and events have different data associated with this. We will need to extract this data in order to make more sense of this dataset. One option here would be to apply json.loads to the event_data and then to utilize json_normalize in order to get it into a DataFrame. I tried this on a different Kernel and ran into a couple of issues, the biggest being that it is computationally expensive to run locally and the resultant DataFrame had a lot of NaNs. Rather than go through this process, a Kaggler has written some code to go through each installation_id and extract all of the activity before an assessment attempt. We will later use this code to preprocess the data. "

Looking at this, the new_train and new_test groups look at each assessment and include a record of all activity before each assessment. The code that was used in order to get this data, and get the information from the event_data, re-creates the labels for the dataset. Also the train_labels values have been recalculated and we no longer need to use this datafame. However, since we have done this, we need to separate the training columns from the training label. We also need to do the same for the test dataset, as we have put that dataframe through the same preprocessing."

    "Before moving on to the modelling aspect, let's split our training data. The best course for model evaluation is to test it ourselves, and then to use our best models to come up with predictions and to evaluate by Kaggle's results. One of the reasons for this is, we would want to use the same evaluation metric, the weighted kappa, and in order to do so, we need to have both predictions and actual values for the test group. The second reason for this is Kaggle, has a Kernel submission limit, meaning that we would encounter a timing roadblock there. With this in mind, keeping Kaggle as a final check seems to be our best course of action for evaluation."

    "This is interesting, our splits showed different weighted kappa test scores, however they were the same across each of the penalties, this suggests that the penalty is not having an impact. The differences in scoring here, could be explained by each split having a different subset of data. When looking at the best model, it showed an l1_ratio=0, which would be the same as using an l2 penalty, using Ridge regularization. When performing the same operation without using GridSearchCV and by using our split training group, a weighted kappa score of 0.0751 was achieved. This was the same for l1_ratios of: 0,0.25,0.5,0.75 and, 1. This supports the earlier finding suggesting that the l1_ratio is not a good hyperparameter to tune on and that it doesn't have an impact here. These attempts performed far worse than our basic Logistic Regression, which had a weighted kappa score of 0.148. "

    "Overall, we found the best model from our experimentation is be the Gradient Boosted Classifier with 100 estimators. This yielded us a Quadratic Weighted Kappa score of approximately, 0.52.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to further improve this model, there are a couple things we could try. We could try some alternative classifier like CatBoost (which other Kagglers seemed to have success with) or we could try a Neural Network Classifier. In addition to that, for our modelling purposes, we were using approximately 100 different features logging the different events that occurred prior to the assessments. We could try to do some dimensionality reduction to see whether or not that helps us create a better performing and more generalized model. Using so many features, it would not be surprising to find that our model has overfit. This is something we could determine once we have submitted our results and a kernel for Kaggle to evaluate. Furthermore, we can always improve by refactoring our code and making it more efficient and simplifying things. \n",
