A Repo for data science projects or practice.

Aptos Blindness Detection: This is a take on the a previous kaggle challenge.

DataSciBowl_Kaggle_MLproject: This was my project for UofT SCS 3253 - Machine Learning. For this project, I competed in the Kaggle Competition [2019 Data Science Bowl](https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2019).

DeepLearningWithPython: Tested the experiments in section 3.5 of the Deep Learning With Python book.

Hexapawn: Adapted of Tic Tac Toe code from Deep Learning and the Game of Go to play Hexapawn. Computer bot uses Minimax algorithm to determine its moves.

Iris Dataset: KNN Classifier implementation on Iris Dataset.

Misc_Hockey: currently contains a scraper written to scrape game summaries from the NHL website.

MontyHallSimulation: Assignment for Statistics Course, objective was to write code to solve Monty Hall problem.

NHL-player-comparables-using-knn: exploring the idea of using KNN to determine a players comparables.

Octopawn: Adaptation of Hexapawn code, to play on a 4x4 grid instead of a 3x3 grid.

PDF Extraction: contains scripts written to extract pdfs to text using Tika and PyPDF2.

Space: This was a team project for UofT SCS 3547 - Intelligent Agents & Reinforcement Learning. Here, we made a game similar to flappy bird that is played using the NEAT algorithm. A demo can be seen [here](https://youtu.be/NKxisEPCE0s)

Titanic Dataset: contains analysis of Titanic Dataset performed for an Assignment.
